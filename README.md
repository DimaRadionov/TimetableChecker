# Timetable Checker

### Details: 
You have received a timetable consisting of ten classes (lectures). Each of them has at
least one but possibly more weekly events booked into one of three available lecture
halls. Furthermore, there is information on two study programs (Mathematics and
Physics): Specifically, for each program, there’s a list of classes which are part of its
respective curriculum. Please note that a class can be in more than one program.
A valid timetable has to fulfill a number of requirements. Among them are these two
rules:
1. At any given time, there can be only one class per room.
2. Classes of the same program cannot be scheduled at the same time.


   We call a violation of the first constraint a “room conflict” and a violation of the
   second one a “curricular conflict”. Task is to write a small software tool that can
   check the provided timetable for the fulfillment of these requirements and output a
   list of each type of conflict, in case they occur.
   
### My solution

You can find my 2 solutions of this task. They are on "main" and "develop" branches. 

To build my solutions just make run at the top of the IDE or click on the "run icon" in the Main class.

If you want to check solutions with the different xml file, make sure to name it timetable.xml or make changes in the Main class at the 33 and 37 rows.
